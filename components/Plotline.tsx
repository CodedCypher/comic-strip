			<Text italic>…Living in the slums, I found myself fighting to survive.</Text>
			<Text>
				As the weak die out and the strong survive. It was a dark, dreary place where food was
				scarce. The government turned a blind eye in this part of the world.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				Without my father, growing up in this world would have been impossible. I've only had my
				father ever since the start. I wouldn’t care about anything else as long as I had him. He
				was there for me growing up. I later learned that my mom died giving birth to me.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				My father was a good man. He was an honorable man. He was the kind of person that would help
				the weak. He was what I would call a hero.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				Life doesn’t always go our way, and I learned that pretty quickly. One day, he just
				vanished. Just disappeared out of my life. He didn’t leave anything or say anything. He just
				left me. He left me in this world all on my own. I never knew why. It may just be a forever
				longing question I may never find the answer to.
			</Text>
			<Text>-Timeskip to the current-</Text>
			<Text>“That… Scy… I… I like you! Please go out with me!”</Text>
			<Text>The fingers of the girl in front anxiously crossed together, her eyes wandering.</Text>
			<Text>
				It may sound extremely cliche to be confessed to by a girl in the classroom after school,
				but the problem is that I don't know her, or maybe I never even noticed her. She claims to
				be my classmate in the same class, and in the barely one month since I started this academy,
				she thought she had fallen in love with me, leading her to this action of confession.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				She has brilliant eyes that hesitantly avoid making eye contact with me, and I can see she
				has bright red cheeks. Also, looking at her, she has a nice figure.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				But really, I have absolutely no impressions of her. It's possible that in situations like
				these, a typical high school freshman may consent to the other side's invitation to go out,
				leading to a life of peach-colored high school romance and daily acts of adoration.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				The girl in front of me is currently staring at me with a hopeful expression; the script she
				wrote herself probably only has one conclusion.
			</Text>
			<Text>“Sorry, I’m not interested.” </Text>
			<Text>
				After hearing my reply, she started to tear up, while quickly dashing away from either the
				embarrassment or shyness. I didn’t mean to come out as arrogant, but the truth is that I
				have no romantic feelings for that girl, whose name I have no idea.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				“Honestly, I kind of feel bad, but it’s better this way.” I'm walking to the computer shop
				alone to play some games to relieve my stress. After my intense gaming session, I saw a
				sketchy ad online about a some-kind of group, but honestly, I clicked on it because “You can
				become a hero!” in the ad. I mean, what else would a typical high-school boy do? Unaware of
				what I’d expect, I was transported to another world.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				“Welcome Hero~, you are destined to slayyyy~ the demon king!” As the really
				attractive-looking elf priestess looks at me with lustful eyes. Also note that she has a
				really big heart. As I lean in for a kiss...
			</Text>
			<Text>*RING RING RING RING* my alarm goes off.</Text>
			<Text>
				I was greeted by my drenched pillow, with quite a big kiss mark. “Uhh…” As I looked around
				to assure that no one saw my embarrassment. “Who am I even kidding, I live alone.”
			</Text>
			<Text>
				Unknowingly, I had already signed up for a resistance group, The Iron Maiden. And my days of
				peace and normal school life were soon to end.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				A few days later, I received a call from an unknown number. I immediately declined, but they
				were persistent with their calls. So I hesitantly answered it.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				“We need you asap. Come to the location we’ll send to you.” said the husky and raspy voice
				over the line.
			</Text>
			<Text>“Why should I?” I responded nervously.</Text>
			<Text>There were a few moments of silence.</Text>
			<Text>“...You could be a hero for the people.” the contacter replied.</Text>
			<Text>
				“...Coming!” I said energetically. Quite excited in fact. My highschool boy senses were
				tingling.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				As I walked to the location. I met a group of people. They were mostly men with an
				intimidating aura, clothes trying hard to their scars and a few women with equally scary
				personalities. I got baited…
			</Text>
			<Text>“Hey, what’s up?” I asked as we greeted each other.</Text>
			<Text>One of the girls pushed me up against the wall. She was a blue-haired beauty.</Text>
			<Text>“Haha... What... Did I say something wrong?” “Why did you push me?”</Text>
			<Text>
				“Come with me if you don’t want to get in trouble.” The blue-haired lady ordered me, while
				dragging me to the next room.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				In the next room, a quick summary of the situation in Manila was given. Apparently, there’s
				a war going on against the government. With the government controlled by the rich, they had
				a hold on most of the common people.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				The rich were in this dome in the center of the city. They called it the Virtual Center; it
				was a place where the rich were able to satisfy their own desires in their made up little
				world virtually. Robots were taking over the jobs of the common people. They made the common
				people take care of them. But they did pay them, albeit so that they could take care of them
				again.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				It was like a never-ending cycle that the rich made up just for them to indulge in their
				desires. I felt like their situation resonates with me. My dad left me all alone in this
				world. I was stuck in a cycle of what I wanted and what I needed to do.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				“Why did I never know this?” I questioned myself. “Why did no-one ever tell me?” It was like
				a great revelation was revealed to me. It opened me to the truth of this world. I was
				honestly disappointed in myself.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				As I pondered with my thoughts. They welcomed me as their newest member to the Iron-Maiden.
				“Welcome! We’re always open to people that want to fight!” As the brown-haired woman with
				the red eyes said to me. She had that fierce attitude that wouldn’t give up just to get what
				they wanted.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				After me and the rest of the group’s meeting, we all rushed to the dome. At the other end,
				we met the other members of the Iron Maiden.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				Once we arrived near the dome, the white-haired lady, who we now know as Liza, told us that
				all we needed to do was, “To clean up.” It was a term meaning that we needed to ‘clean up’
				the city from its impurities. We need to make it spotless from all the dirt. Take it back
				from the government’s control. Honestly, I wasn’t ready, but there was no time to be ready.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				The problem was, there were plenty of pissed off government people that we needed to handle.
				The government has the upper hand when it comes to equipment, but we have more personnel. It
				was my first time fighting for something, my first in life to do something not for myself.
				I’m not a very ambitious person, but I believe this is right.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				I saw a glimpse of two members looking at each other’s eyes, as if they were communicating,
				and understood that this might be the last time they’ll ever see each other. They nodded to
				each other as they walked away towards their own groups. I quickly understood that they're
				not doing it for themselves. This is a life and death for the freedom of oppression.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				Did I ever regret it? No. I had no one else in my life to ever fight for, to live for. This
				battle is a battle to determine myself. To find what’s truly important in life.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				I went up to one of the leaders. I wanted to know the details of their plan, but they didn’t
				give me any chance to do so.
			</Text>
			<Text>Liza: “Let’s split up, with each group going to different areas.”</Text>
			<Text>
				“I’ll go to street A, you guys go to street B, and so on. You don’t need to wait for me.”{" "}
			</Text>
			<Text>“Go ahead and go!” She ordered.</Text>
			<Text>“I’ll come with you.” I answered.</Text>
			<Text>“Thanks.” She smiled and said, “Umm." Why is it that you joined us?"</Text>
			<Text>
				“I joined because the government has gone insane, and I want to put a stop to their actions
				.” Honestly, I really couldn’t just say that I joined because I wanna be a hero.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				As we arrived at street A, we were greeted by…the various ruined structures in the
				background. Faint sounds of moans and screams. Explosive smoke everywhere. It was dark, and
				lonely. The only sense of comfort I found was the dim light emitting from the lamp posts.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				It was strange. We anticipated a full-blown battle, but were greeted by nothing. It was as
				if they knew it.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				After a while, I suddenly felt a strange feeling, like a gaze upon me. It was as if I’m
				being watched from afar. I didn’t know where, but there was no one around. Maybe it was just
				my imagination?
			</Text>
			<Text>
				“Why don’t we rest here for a while.” As one of our members found a lodging for us to rest
				in. There wasn’t much we were doing anyways. I was disappointed but relieved at the same
				time. I didn’t think I was ready yet for this. I pondered on my thoughts for a while.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				One of the older members, Kyle, approached me. “Hey, what’s up newbie!” I vaguely remember
				him as the person who met with his friend for the last time.
			</Text>
			<Text>Scy: “Yea, hey.”</Text>
			<Text>Kyle: “No need to be so cold.”</Text>
			<Text>“Scy: I’m just a little nervous.”</Text>
			<Text>
				Kyle: “Haha! I was like you once. But life can change you when you least expect you to.” It
				was like he was trying to comfort me. It wasn’t really helping, but just having someone to
				talk to at this time really mattered.
			</Text>
			<Text>Kyle: “Why’d you come here for someone as young as you?” He questioned me.</Text>
			<Text>I really didn’t like that he discriminated against me being young.</Text>
			<Text>
				Scy: “I really have nothing else to do. My father died when I was young, so I don’t have
				anyone else to live for.”
			</Text>
			<Text>Kyle: “Oh…I’m sorry for that.”</Text>
			<Text>Scy: “It’s fine. I’m over it now.”</Text>
			<Text>
				Kyle: “Y’know I had a son like you once. He was a bit younger than you. I still remember
				that he was a very stubborn kid. He was the type that would do anything to get what he
				wanted. I don’t know who he inherited it from. Haha…but I loved him for who he was. He
				reminded his mom really well.”
			</Text>
			<Text>Scy: “Where is he now?”</Text>
			<Text>
				Kyle: “...” He stayed quiet for a while. It was like he didn't wanna remember it: it was
				heavy on his chest.
			</Text>
			<Text>Scy: “...I’m sorry.” </Text>
			<Text>
				As we were talking, we were interrupted by a transmission. It was one of the scouts that was
				sent to survey the surroundings.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				“..Th…gove..rn…ment….her…e” His message was choppy. We also heard the faint conversation of
				someone else in his transmission “Th..e..re..bels” “..Th..s..co..t…th…clo…se..by”
			</Text>
			<Text>“What? Link, do you copy?” Our leader asked him.</Text>
			<Text>
				“...” There was no response. Just a static white noise. We couldn’t get to him. Maybe his
				transmitter is broken or it got blocked. But it was enough for us to assume that something
				or someone was coming.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				“Everyone, ready up!” Our leader commanded us to prepare for battle. But as we were getting
				ready. We heard someone yell, “It’s the rebels!”
			</Text>
			<Text>
				It was too late. The government already found our location. They’ve surrounded us already.
				We couldn’t escape, but only had the choice we had was to fight. So we did
			</Text>
			<Text>
				We held our heads up high, and wished for a bright morning of glory. As this might be the
				day I die, I’m not prepared for it, but what else am I to do? This day I hardened my will
				and looked upon the bright morning of victory.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				As Scy fought for the rebels, oppressed people, and his life, he was shot 12 times in his
				torso.
			</Text>
			<Text>“I guess this is how I die.”</Text>
			<Text>“Not very honorable in any way…” </Text>
			<Text>
				“Sorry Mom and Dad. I couldn’t be the kind of person you wanted me to be. I’m sorry for
				everything.”
			</Text>
			<Text>Those were the last words Scy muttered to himself as he gave up his life.</Text>
			<Text>“...”</Text>
			<Text>“Ugh…” </Text>
			<Text>“My body hurts…”</Text>
			<Text>“Damn…What happened?”</Text>
			<Text>As Scy opened his eyes he was greeted by his off white ceiling.</Text>
			<Text>“What time is it?” Scy gets out of bed to see his gloomy room.</Text>
			<Text>“9? It’s already 9?”</Text>
			<Text>“No! I’m late for school.”</Text>
			<Text>Scy then swiftly prepared for school. </Text>
			<Text>“I didn’t forget anything did I?”</Text>
			<Text>“Yep!”</Text>
			<Text>After he checks his belongings, he then departs to school. </Text>
			<Text>
				As Scy arrives at his school, he is greeted by the sounds and sights of the bright morning
				of a typical Filipino Public Highschool.
			</Text>
			<Text>“Here we go again.”</Text>
			<Text>He gets to his room and is met with a letter below his desk. </Text>
			<Text>“What is this?”</Text>
			<Text>
				Curious of what is inside, he opened it. It was a love letter. Someone was confessing to
				Scy, but Scy was oblivious to it, or rather he didn’t care.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				“Hey Scy…Let’s meet after school in the classroom. I want to tell you something ” This was
				the typical love letter.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				“Ugh…this is gonna be a hassle, but whatever.” Was his reply as he read the letter.
			</Text>
			<Text>After school ended, he met the girl in the location she wrote in the letter.</Text>
			<Text>“That… Scy… I… I like you! Please go out with me!”</Text>
			<Text>Nathaniel: “Wait, Mom…you said this before?”</Text>
			<Text>Nathaniel: “Doesn’t this mean he’s in some sort of loop?”</Text>
			<Text>Delia: “Yes, anak.”</Text>
			<Text>
				Delia: “He may know or not, but we do know that this takes place in the Virtual Center.”
			</Text>
			<Text>Nathaniel: “Ohh…”</Text>
			<Text>Nathaniel: “Is it a really bad place?”</Text>
			<Text>Delia: “No. Not everybody there is. Remember your dad was also a part of it.”</Text>
			<Text>Nathaniel: “Then how did you and Dad escape?”</Text>
			<Text>Delia: “Because of my love for your Dad.”</Text>
			<Text>Delia: “Love can overcome anything. As long as it’s true.”</Text>
			<Text>
				Nathaniel looks at his Mom’s eyes intently, trying to figure out what she would have meant
				by it.
			</Text>
			<Text>Art: “Guys! Dinner is ready!”</Text>
			<Text>Delia: “Oh, your Dad is calling for dinner. Let’s get ready.”</Text>
			<Text>Nathaniel: “Ok, Mom.”</Text>
			<Text>Nathaniel and his Mom, Delia, prepare for dinner.</Text>
			<Text>Nathaniel: “Coming Dad!”</Text>
			<Text>
				This is where our story ends, but their story begins. As they live on their little island
				off the coast of Manila. This is another beginning after the end. As a happy family. Or is
				it?
